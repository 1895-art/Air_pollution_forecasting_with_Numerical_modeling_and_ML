# Forecasting_on_air_pollution_with_Numerical_analysis_and_ML (20200902 ~ )
- This project is designed to predict the levels of air pollution in South Korea by using numerical modeling and machine learning techniques.
- This project is maintained by 오서영, [신영민](https://github.com/young3984)


## Process
> 1. Refine location (latitude, longitude), wind directional/speed, air pollution dataset [[code]]()  
> 2. Visualization with MATLAB, Simple implementaion of numerical modeling with refined dataset [[code]]()
