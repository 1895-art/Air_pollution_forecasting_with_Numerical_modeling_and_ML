# Forecasting_on_air_pollution_with_Numerical_analysis_and_ML (20200902 ~ )
- This project is designed to predict the levels of air pollution in South Korea by using numerical modeling and machine learning techniques.
- This project is maintained by 오서영, [신영민](https://github.com/young3984)


## Process
**1**. Refin location (latitude/longitude), wind (directional/speed), air pollution dataset [[code]](https://github.com/OH-Seoyoung/Forecasting_on_air_pollution_with_Numerical_analysis_and_ML/blob/master/1_Make_location%2Cwind%2C%2Cair_pollution_dataset/Make_location_and_wind_directional%2Cspeed_dataset.ipynb)  
**2**. Visualization with MATLAB, Simple implementaion of numerical modeling with refined dataset [[code]](https://github.com/OH-Seoyoung/Forecasting_on_air_pollution_with_Numerical_analysis_and_ML/tree/master/2_Visualization_and_Simple_numerical_modeling)

It is realistically impossible to obtain wind and air pollution data at all points due to problems such as cost and time.  
So we came up with a way to get empty space data through **interpolation**.

**3**. IDW
